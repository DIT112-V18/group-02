## SafeSweeper (group-02)
*The cheap and safe way of disabling land mines*

### What?
A cheap, small, remotely driven car with the capabilities of detecting mines underneath to enable them to be safely disarmed.

### Why?
Each year, over [5000](http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/landmine-monitor-2017/casualties.aspx) people are injured by land mines. Most of those are civilians, which makes this a huge humanitarian issue.
